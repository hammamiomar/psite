      Hey! Welcome to my site. This is where I document my
      adventures in code, cooking, and everything in between. Whether you're
      here for the machine learning projects, the Rust experiments, or just
      curious about my latest kitchen output – I'm glad you stopped by. Feel
      free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if something sparks your
      interest!
    </p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      <p>
        I'm Omar – a software engineer who can't sit still when there's
        something new to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey started at NYU where I fell in love with data visualization
        and seeing patterns come alive. That curiosity led me down the ML rabbit
        hole through computer vision research (countless hours
        squinting at traffic cameras later). Recently, I rediscovered my love
        for systems programming during my Recurse Center batch – turns out Rust
        is incredibly fun when you're building computer vision music visualizers.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, you'll find me jumping between implementing ML algorithms into real world use cases,
        optimizing real-time systems, building full-stack apps, consuming technical literature, and
        experimenting with audio processing (because music makes everything
        better). I thrive in small teams where wearing many hats isn't just
        accepted – it's expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not at my computer, I'm probably in the kitchen optimizing serious eats recipes
        or at the gym. I love seeing results of my work in any shape or form.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in learning by consuming egregious amounts of literature 
        surrounding a topic, and then rapid experimenation based on the gained intuition.
        The human brain is a very porous sponge where whatever you learn, will eventually leak out in mysterious and productive
        ways, giving you solutions that you never would have imagined. 
      </p>
