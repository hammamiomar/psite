These classic chocolate chip cookies are the perfect balance of crispy edges and soft, chewy centers. They're loaded with chocolate chips and have that perfect homemade taste.

## Ingredients

- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

### Step 2: Mix dry ingredients
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

### Step 3: Cream butter and sugars
In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer).

### Step 4: Add eggs and vanilla
Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.

### Step 5: Combine wet and dry
Gradually blend in the flour mixture until just combined. Don't overmix!

### Step 6: Add chocolate chips
Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.

### Step 7: Bake
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.

### Step 8: Cool
Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips

- **Room temperature ingredients**: Make sure your eggs and butter are at room temperature for best mixing
- **Don't overbake**: Cookies will look slightly underdone when you remove them, but they'll continue cooking on the hot pan
- **Storage**: Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week
